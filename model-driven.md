# Model-Driven Testing

“software testing where test cases are derived in whole or in part from a model that describes some (if not all) aspects of the system under test (SUT)”

The system under test may be something as simple as a method or class, or as complex as a complete system or a solution consisting of systems of systems. 

It assumes that the SUT is modified when a given operation is called. It is intended for dealing with systems that are mutable.

Model-Driven Testing uses formal models of a SUT to generatetests and to access the success or failure of these testes.

A model is a formal abstraction of a complex problem or system which should be solved or implemented in software or hardware.
