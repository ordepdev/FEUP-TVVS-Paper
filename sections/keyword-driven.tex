\section{Keyword-Driven}

Keyword-driven testing is a logical extension to data-driven testing~\cite{Fewster99}.
Besides test data it also makes use of keywords in order to instruct how the
data is read from the external data source and to be interpreted by the test
scripts. It combines the data-driven technique with the desire to be able to
specify automated test cases without having to specify all the excessive detail.

The key to keyword-driven testing is to identify the right keywords.
